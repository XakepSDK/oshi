OSHI is a free JNA-based (native) Operating System and Hardware Information library for Java.
It does not require the installation of any additional native libraries and aims to provide a 
cross-platform implementation to retrieve system information, such as OS version, processes, 
memory & CPU usage, disks & partitions, devices, sensors, etc.

* Operating System and Version/Build
* Physical (core) and Logical (hyperthreaded) CPUs 
* System and per-processor load % and tick counters
* CPU uptime, processes, and threads
* Process uptime, CPU, memory usage
* Physical and virtual memory used/available
* Mounted filesystems (type, usable and total space)
* Disk drives (model, serial, size) and partitions

Output
-------------
OSHI provides output directly via Java methods for each of its interfaces.  
By periodically polling dynamic information (e.g., every second), users can calculate and track changes.

The `main()` method of [SystemInfoTest](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-core/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java) 
provides sample code demonstrating the use of `oshi-core` interfaces to retrieve information and calculate additional metrics shown in the examples below.

You can run the [SystemInfoTest](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-core/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java)
and see the full output for your system by cloning the project and building it with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/index.html).

```
git clone https://github.com/oshi/oshi.git && cd oshi

mvn test-compile -pl oshi-core -q exec:java \
  -Dexec.mainClass="oshi.SystemInfoTest" \
  -Dexec.classpathScope="test"
```

Where are we? How can I help?
-----------------------------
[OSHI originated](http://code.dblock.org/2010/06/23/introducing-oshi-operating-system-and-hardware-information-java.html) 
as a platform-independent library that did not require additional software and had a license compatible with 
both open source and commercial products. We have developed a strong core of features on major Operating Systems, 
but we would love for *you* to help by:
* Testing!  Our CI testing is limited.  Download and test the program on various operating systems/versions and hardware and help identify gaps that our limited development and testing may have missed.
* Contributing ports.  Have an OS that's not covered? It's likely one of the existing ports can be slightly modified. 
* Offering access to an unsupported OS.  An AIX port will be written if access for development/testing can be provided!
* Contributing code.  See something that's not working right or could work better?  Help us fix it!  New contributors welcome.
* Documenting implementation.  Our Wiki is sparse.  Want to help new users follow in your footsteps?
* Suggesting new features.  Do you need OSHI to do something it doesn't currently do?  Let us know.
